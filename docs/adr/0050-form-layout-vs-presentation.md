# ADR-0050: Form layout vs presentation — split the overloaded `FormView.type`

**Status**: Proposed (2026-06-15)
**Deciders**: ObjectStack Protocol Architects
**Builds on**: [ADR-0014](./0014-record-form-field-type.md) (record form field type), [ADR-0017](./0017-object-has-many-view.md) (object-bound views), [ADR-0049](./0049-no-unenforced-security-properties.md) (declared ≠ enforced discipline)
**Consumers**: `@objectstack/spec` (`ui/view.zod.ts` `FormViewSchema`), `@object-ui/plugin-form` (`ObjectForm` + `TabbedForm`/`WizardForm`/`SplitForm`/`DrawerForm`/`ModalForm`), `@object-ui/app-shell` (`RecordFormPage`, `AppContent`, `useActionModal`), examples + templates form views.
**Surfaced by**: framework #1890 (viewschema liveness audit) → objectui #1762 (full-page form layout fix) → the modelling debt found while browser-verifying it.

## TL;DR

`FormViewSchema.type` is a single enum holding **two orthogonal dimensions**:

| value | real meaning | dimension |
|---|---|---|
| `simple` / `tabbed` / `wizard` | the form's internal **layout** | **Layout** |
| `drawer` / `modal` | where the form is **opened** | **Presentation / container** |
| `split` | a list+detail master-detail mode | neither — a *view mode* |

Because it's one field, **"a modal containing a tabbed form" is inexpressible** — `type` can only be `modal` *or* `tabbed`. That's exactly why the real modal create/edit entry points (`AppContent`, `useActionModal`) set `formType:'modal'` and the form inside can only ever be `simple`.

**Decision: split the dimensions.** `FormView.type` becomes **layout only** (`simple` | `tabbed` | `wizard`). Presentation (drawer/modal/inline/page) is already a *caller* concern and already modelled elsewhere — reuse it. `split` is removed (master-detail is already `subforms` + the list's split-detail open mode).

---

## Context — the presentation dimension already exists (3 places)

The audit + the #1762 browser verification established that `ObjectForm` **already implements every variant** (real `TabbedForm`/`WizardForm`/`SplitForm`; `drawer`/`modal` fall through to `DrawerForm`/`ModalForm`). The gap was entry wiring (fixed for the full-page route in #1762).

Crucially, "how a form is opened" is **already** spec'd, independently of `FormView.type`:

- **Detail open mode** — `NavigationModeSchema`: `page` / `drawer` / `modal` / `split` / `popover` (`view.zod.ts`).
- **Add-record mode** — list `addRecord.mode`: `inline` / `form` / `modal` + `formView`.
- **Action open** — action `type:'modal'` + `target`.

So `drawer`/`modal`/`split` *as `FormView.type` values* are **redundant with — and orthogonal to — these**. And they have **zero real business usage**: the only definitions are 5 showcase/template *named* views built to demo variants (`app-showcase task.view` `split`/`quick`; `hotcrm lead.view` `split`/`drawer`/`modal`). No default form view, no business flow depends on them.

## Decision

1. **`FormView.type` = layout only**: `z.enum(['simple','tabbed','wizard'])` (default `simple`).
2. **Remove `drawer` / `modal` from `FormView.type`.** A form is *placed in* a drawer/modal by the **caller** (list `addRecord.mode`, `NavigationMode`, action `type:'modal'`), and the container renders an `ObjectForm` whose `type` is a *layout*. This makes "modal + tabbed" expressible — the whole point.
3. **Remove `split` from `FormView.type`.** Master-detail is already `subforms` (single-record parent/child) + the list's `NavigationMode:'split'` (list+detail). A form-level `split` is a third, redundant spelling.
4. **`ObjectForm` drops its `drawer`/`modal`/`split` branches** (`DrawerForm`/`ModalForm` become caller-supplied containers; `SplitForm` retires in favour of `subforms`). It keeps `simple`/`tabbed`/`wizard`.

## Migration (low cost — breaking spec, tiny blast radius)

- Spec: narrow the `FormViewSchema.type` enum (spec-major: the removed values are a breaking surface change).
- Renderer: remove the 3 retired `ObjectForm` branches.
- The 5 demo named views (showcase `task` split/quick, hotcrm `lead` split/drawer/modal): convert to `tabbed`/`simple` layout demos, and demo the *open modes* via the list's `NavigationMode` / `addRecord.mode` instead. No business metadata changes.
- Reconcile with the deferred entry wiring: modal/drawer create/edit (`AppContent`/`useActionModal`) should forward the form view's *layout* into the container (so a modal can host a tabbed form) — the concrete follow-up this re-model unlocks.

## Consequences

- **Positive.** Authors describe *structure* with `type` (layout) and *placement* with the existing open-mode fields — no overloaded field, and modal/drawer forms can finally be tabbed/wizard. Smaller, honest `FormView` surface; one master-detail spelling.
- **Negative / cost.** Breaking enum narrowing (spec-major). Requires a coordinated spec + `plugin-form` + examples/templates change. Mitigated by the near-zero real usage of the removed values.
- **Sequencing.** This ADR is the design; implementation is a spec-major change (like ADR-0021's cutover) and should land after architect sign-off, ideally bundled with the modal/drawer layout-forwarding follow-up so the "modal + tabbed" capability ships demonstrably.

## Non-goals

- Re-modelling `NavigationMode` / `addRecord.mode` / action `modal` — they already carry presentation; this ADR *reuses* them.
- The viewschema key-drift cleanup (objectui#1763) — separate.
