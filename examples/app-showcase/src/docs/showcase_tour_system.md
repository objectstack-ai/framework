# Guided tour — System

Everything in this domain lives under `src/system/` (plus the pinned flat
`src/docs/` directory this page is part of).

## Datasources & federation

`src/system/datasources/` declares a second, read-only SQLite file as an
**external datasource** (ADR-0015 / ADR-0062). It auto-connects at boot with
no driver wiring; its federated objects (External Customer / External
Order) are queryable via REST and visible in **Setup → Datasources**. The
`external_catalog` snapshot is produced at runtime by the Sync wizard —
there is no declarative artifact, so the coverage manifest waives that kind
with the tracking issue.

## i18n & email

- `src/system/translations/` — the `en` + `zh-CN` bundles; switch locale in
  the console and the navigation follows.
- `src/system/emails/` — outbound email templates used by the automation
  chain.

## Docs & books — this manual is metadata

Every Markdown file in flat `src/docs/` compiles to a `doc` item
(ADR-0046); `src/system/books/` curates them into the spine you are
reading, exposed publicly through the library portal. The
[documentation guide](./showcase_docs_guide.md) states the authoring rules
this very page obeys.

## Code-only surfaces

`src/system/server/recalc-endpoint.ts` mounts a custom REST endpoint
imperatively — the code-level counterpart of the `router` / `function` /
`service` kinds, which have no declarative authoring surface today (waived
in the coverage manifest with the tracking issue).
