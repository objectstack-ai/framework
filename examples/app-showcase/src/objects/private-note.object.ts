/**
 * Personal Note — the canonical OWNER-PRIVATE object (ADR-0056, declarative OWD).
 *
 * It declares `sharingModel: 'private'` and nothing else: no hand-written RLS
 * policy, no owner predicate, no permission-set rule. The engine derives owner
 * scoping from the Org-Wide-Default baseline + the auto-stamped `owner_id` — a
 * user sees and edits only the notes they own.
 *
 * This is the declarative counterpart to the invoice's hand-written
 * `owner = current_user.email` escape-hatch (PR #2054): for plain "my records
 * are mine" ownership, an object declares ONE WORD and the platform enforces it.
 * The corresponding dogfood proof (`showcase-private-owd.dogfood.test.ts`) shows
 * two users each seeing only their own notes through the real HTTP stack.
