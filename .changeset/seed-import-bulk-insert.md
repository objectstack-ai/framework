Seed loader and data-import now route bulk writes through the engine's array-form `insert()` (one round-trip per batch, with parent-deduplicated summary recompute) instead of one `insert()`/`createData()` call per record, and both retry transient driver errors instead of silently dropping the row (#2678).

A new shared helper, `bulkWrite` (`@objectstack/core`), batches rows through a caller-supplied batch-write function, retries a whole-batch transient failure (network blip / timeout) with exponential backoff, and degrades to per-row writes (each itself retried) when a batch fails for a non-transient reason — so one bad row can't drop the other N-1. `withTransientRetry` wraps a single write (e.g. an update) with the same retry behavior.

- `SeedLoaderService.loadDataset()` (`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`) buffers insert-mode records and flushes them in batches of 200 via the engine's array `insert()`. Datasets with a self-referencing field (e.g. `employee.manager_id -> employee`) keep the historical per-record write path, since a later record may need an earlier one's freshly-assigned id.
- `runImport()` (`@objectstack/rest`) buffers create-resolved rows and flushes them via `protocol.createManyData()` when the protocol supports it, falling back to the original per-row `createData()` call otherwise. `Protocol.createManyData` (`@objectstack/metadata-protocol`) now forwards `context` to `engine.insert()` like `createData` already did, so tenant-scoped bulk creates work correctly.

Previously, a 1000-row seed or import into an object with a rollup summary issued 1000+ round-trips and up to 1000 summary recomputes; a single transient network error on any one row silently dropped it with no retry (the 2026-07-06 HotCRM first-boot incident). A `bulkCreate`-capable driver now sees roughly `ceil(N/batch)` writes, and a transient error is retried before a row is ever reported as failed.
