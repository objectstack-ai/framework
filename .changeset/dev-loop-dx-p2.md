Dev-loop DX fixes from the 15.1 third-party evaluation (P2 batch):

- **Hot-added objects are now queryable without a restart.** Adding a `*.object.ts` under `os dev` used to recompile "green" while every query answered `no such table` (or `not registered`) until a manual restart: the artifact reload never notified the ObjectQL registry, tables were only created at boot, and seeds only loaded from the boot-time bundle. The `metadata:reloaded` payload now carries the parsed artifact; ObjectQL ingests the object definitions and re-runs the idempotent schema sync (same `skipSchemaSync` opt-out as boot), and the runtime loads seeds for first-seen objects (dev, single-tenant). `os dev` also prints `✚ new object(s): …` on recompile.
- **Dev admin credentials stay visible.** The `os dev` startup banner only showed `admin@objectos.ai / admin123` on the boot that actually seeded it; with the persistent default DB every later boot hid it, and the Console login page never knew it existed. The hint now re-arms on every dev boot for as long as the account still verifies against the default password, and `GET /api/v1/auth/config` exposes a dev-gated `devSeedAdmin` field (never present outside `NODE_ENV=development`) so the login page can show it.
- **`os doctor` reference analysis understands current metadata shapes.** Objects bound through `defineView` containers (`list`/`listViews`/`form`/`formViews` → `data.object`, subform `childObject`, lookup form fields) and app navigation (`objectName`, nested `children`, `areas`) were reported as "defined but not referenced". The collector now walks the canonical shapes (plus flow node `config.object`/`objectName`) and the orphan-view check descends into containers.
