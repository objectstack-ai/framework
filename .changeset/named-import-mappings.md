feat(rest,spec): named import mappings (#2611) — `POST /data/:object/import` accepts `mappingName`, resolving a registered `defineMapping` artifact (stack `mappings:`) and applying its fieldMapping pipeline (rename + constant/map/split/join; lookup delegates to the built-in reference resolution) as a strict projection before coercion. The artifact's `mode`/`upsertKey` serve as writeMode/matchFields defaults; explicit request values win. Errors are loud and specific: `MAPPING_NOT_FOUND`, `MAPPING_TARGET_MISMATCH`, `MAPPING_FORMAT_MISMATCH`, `CONFLICTING_MAPPING` (mutually exclusive with the inline rename), and `UNSUPPORTED_TRANSFORM` for `javascript` (no server-side sandbox — never silently skipped). `defineStack` cross-reference validation now rejects mappings targeting undefined objects and `javascript` transforms at build time.
