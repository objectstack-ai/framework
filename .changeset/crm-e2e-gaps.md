fix: two runtime gaps found by driving the CRM example end-to-end.

**Delete of a parent with a required-FK child no longer fails with a misleading "<field> is required" error.** `cascadeDeleteRelations` defaulted a `lookup` FK to `set_null`; for a *required* FK that issued an UPDATE clearing the column, which the child's validator rejected with a `400 "<field> is required"` naming a field that isn't even on the object being deleted (e.g. deleting a `crm_account` with opportunities → `"account is required"`). A required FK can't be nulled, so a *defaulted* `set_null` now escalates to `restrict`: the delete is refused with a clear `409 DELETE_RESTRICTED` carrying the dependent object + count (`"Cannot delete crm_account (…): 4 dependent crm_opportunity record(s) reference it via account … set deleteBehavior:'cascade'"`). Explicit `cascade`/`restrict` and optional (nullable) lookups are unchanged.

**Removed the hardcoded `POST /data/lead/:id/convert` endpoint + `convertLead` protocol method.** It hardcoded bare object names (`lead`/`account`/`contact`/`opportunity`) and a fixed Salesforce field mapping into the framework runtime, so it was unreachable by any real (namespaced) app — `/data/crm_lead/:id/convert` 404s, and the literal `lead` object doesn't exist. Lead conversion is an app concern modeled correctly as a flow (the CRM ships a `crm_convert_lead_wizard` screen flow); baking a CRM-specific workflow into the framework was false surface. Untested, undocumented, unused by the example. Removed.
