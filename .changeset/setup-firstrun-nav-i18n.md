fix(setup): first-run admin polish — pin Company/Localization, gate dashboard widgets by `requiresService`, i18n + settings PUT envelope

Dogfooding the Setup app as a brand-new system administrator surfaced a cluster of small first-run gaps, now fixed:

- **platform-objects**: pin **Localization** and **Company** in the Setup sidebar's Configuration group — both are registered `service-settings` manifests (the two lowest-`order` Workspace settings) but were reachable only via the "All Settings" hub. Translate the previously-English nav labels Cloud Connection (云连接), Datasources (数据源) and Capabilities (能力). Tag the System Overview `widget_organizations` KPI with `requiresService: 'org-scoping'`.
- **rest**: extend the ADR-0057 D10 server-side visibility gate to **dashboard widgets** — strip widgets whose `requiresService` names an unregistered kernel service (mirrors the existing app-nav gate; `resolveRegisteredServices` now also discovers gates declared on widgets). In a single-tenant runtime this removes the orphan "Organizations" KPI, matching the already-hidden org nav entries.
- **service-settings**: add the missing zh `help` strings for the Localization manifest (number/currency/first-day-of-week/fiscal-year fields), and accept the `{ values: { … } }` envelope on `PUT /api/settings/:ns` symmetrically with what `GET` returns.
