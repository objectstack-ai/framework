'@objectstack/lint': patch

Load Sucrase lazily in `validateReactPages` instead of at module top level — the same kernel boot-path contract applied to the TypeScript compiler in `validateReactPageProps` (framework#2544).

`@objectstack/lint` sits on the kernel boot path, so the eager `import { transform } from 'sucrase'` made every boot parse ~1.5 MB of transpiler (~16 ms cold require) for a syntax gate that only runs when a `kind:'react'` page is actually validated — a rare, trusted-tier case. Sucrase now loads on the first validated react-source page via the same deferred-createRequire pattern; the public API stays synchronous and unchanged, `sucrase` stays a regular dependency, and if the package is missing at call time validation fails with an actionable error instead of killing boot.

The boot-path guard test is generalized from `lazy-typescript.test.ts` to `lazy-deps.test.ts` and now covers both deps at all three levels (structural no-eager-import scan over src, child-process probes of both built dist formats, in-process lazy-load behavior) — verified to go red for each dep when its eager import is reintroduced.
