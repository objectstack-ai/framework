Self-hosted binding becomes consumable (cloud ADR-0008 consumption side): `ConnectionCredentialStore` persists the one-time `oscc_` runtime bearer the bind flow returns (0600, env-local); all control-plane forwards fall back to it when no `OS_CLOUD_API_KEY` is set; new `POST /cloud-connection/unbind` revokes + clears; install-local's catalog fetch presents the credential so org/private packages resolve. The binding Setup UI ships WITH the plugin as SDUI metadata (`cloud_connection_settings` page + Setup-nav contribution, ADR-0029 K2) — the console only registers the `cloud-connection:panel` widget.
