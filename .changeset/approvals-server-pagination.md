Approvals server-side pagination + search pushdown (#1745). `listRequests` accepts `q` / `limit` / `offset` — free-text search pushes into the engine query as an `$or` of `$contains` terms (the `payload_json` snapshot carries record titles, so titles match without a join), and the page window pushes down whenever the filter is fully pushable; approver/status-array filters still post-filter their bounded scan and window in memory (the documented residual until the approver join-table follow-up). New `countRequests` returns the unwindowed total (engine `count` when pushable). REST: `GET /approvals/requests` gains `q`/`limit`/`offset` and returns `{data, total}` when paging.
