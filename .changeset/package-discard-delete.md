feat(packages): one-click discard-drafts and full delete for a package

Two distinct package-level lifecycle operations, both built on the per-item delete primitive:

- **`discardPackageDrafts(packageId)`** — drop every pending DRAFT bound to the package, reverting it to its last published baseline. NON-destructive: active/published metadata and physical tables are untouched. Use case: "I edited this app for a while and it turned out worse than before — abandon all my changes." Routes through the sys_metadata path (no metadata-service dependency, unlike the existing `POST /packages/:id/revert`, which 503s without a metadata service). REST: `POST /packages/:id/discard-drafts`.

- **`deletePackage(packageId)`** — remove the ENTIRE package: every `sys_metadata` row (active + draft) and, by default, the physical table of each object it defined (DESTRUCTIVE). `keepData: true` removes metadata but preserves tables; the `sys_`-table guard still applies. Use case: "I don't want this package anymore." `DELETE /packages/:id` now performs this persisted removal in addition to the in-memory registry unregister it already did (previously it left AI/runtime packages' rows and tables behind); `?keepData=true` opts out of teardown.

Drafts are deleted before active rows so each object's table is torn down exactly once. Per-item failures are collected without aborting the rest.
