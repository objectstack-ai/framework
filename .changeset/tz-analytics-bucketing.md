fix(analytics): make organization timezone actually drive date-dimension bucketing (ADR-0053 Phase 2, #1982)

Date-bucketed analytics silently ignored the reference timezone end-to-end. Three independent seams were broken:

- **service-analytics** — `NativeSQLStrategy` (priority 10) won every cube/dataset query on a SQL driver, but it groups by the raw column (no `date_trunc`) and ignores `timezone`, so a date dimension never bucketed (one row per raw timestamp) and a non-UTC zone was dropped. It now declines queries that carry a `timeDimensions[].granularity`, handing them to `ObjectQLStrategy` → `engine.aggregate` (native bucketing when UTC-safe, uniform in-memory bucketing when non-UTC).
- **objectql** — the in-memory `count` aggregation treated the `*` count-all sentinel (the Cube `count` measure / a fieldless dataset `count`, both compiled to `sql: '*'`) as a column name, counting non-null of a non-existent property → `0` for every bucket. The driver's `COUNT(*)` masked it; the in-memory path (non-UTC date buckets, `driver-rest`/`driver-memory`) returned zeros. `*` is now counted as all rows.
- **rest** — `resolveExecCtx` never resolved the localization timezone/locale, so `/analytics/dataset/query` always ran with `timezone: 'UTC'`. It now resolves them through the `settings` service (honouring the 4-tier cascade incl. the `OS_LOCALIZATION_TIMEZONE` env override), mirroring the dispatcher path.
