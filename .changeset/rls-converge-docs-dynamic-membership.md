Converge the RLS contract with the reference compiler, and wire §7.3.1 dynamic membership.

- **spec (docs)**: narrow `rls.zod.ts` to the four expression forms the compiler actually implements — `field = current_user.<prop>`, `field = 'literal'`, `field IN (current_user.<array>)`, and `1 = 1`. Removed the over-promised surface (subqueries, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, `LIKE`/`ILIKE`, regex, `ANY`/`ALL`, `NOT IN`, `IS NULL`, `NOW()`/`CURRENT_DATE`) from the operator list, context-variable list, and `@example` policies, and documented the fail-closed behaviour explicitly.
- **spec (schema)**: `ExecutionContext` gains `rlsMembership?: Record<string, string[]>` — a bag of pre-resolved dynamic-membership id arrays (team members, territory accounts, shared records) that the runtime stages so RLS can scope via `field IN (current_user.<key>)` without subquery support. Generalizes the previously hard-coded `org_user_ids`.
- **plugin-security**: `RLSCompiler.compileFilter` merges `rlsMembership` keys into the user context (arrays only, never clobbering the named `id`/`organization_id`/`roles`/`org_user_ids` fields), so §7.3.1 hierarchy- and sharing-based policies compile. `compileExpression` now recognizes `1 = 1` as always-true (empty filter), making `RLS.allowAllPolicy` grant access instead of silently failing closed. Missing/empty membership sets still fail closed.
